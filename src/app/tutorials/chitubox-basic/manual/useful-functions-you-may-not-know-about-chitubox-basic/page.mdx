# Useful Functions You May Not Know About CHITUBOX Basic

CHITUBOX Basic is a powerful pre-processing software that integrates model processing, editing, support generation, slicing and etc. Even a series of resin and print parameter datas are included. In fact, besides CHITUBOX Basic's powerful and obvious functions, there are still many small and convenient hidden functions which may not be so obvious for users who are not familiar with CHITUBOX Basic. Here, letâ€™s reveal those hidden features of CHITUBOX Basic.

## Redo and Undo Functions in Support Mode

CHITUBOX Basic provides redo and undo functions in support mode: undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y). After manually adding supports, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z to undo the operation. If you want to cancel the undo operation, you can shortcut Ctrl+Y to do it again.

## TAB for Parameter Modification after Slicing

After finishing slicing or importing the slicing file, there is no need to return to the main interface to modify some parameters. You can directly click the triangle arrow below to pop up the parameter modification TAB which can modify and edit the exposure time, lift distance, lift speed, bottom exposure time, layer height, and retract speed. Then save the slicing file.

## Flatten by Face

In the TAB that appears after clicking the rotate button, there is an option that needs to be checked: "flatten by face". After checking, just click the face that needs to be placed flat. Then the part will be automatically placed flat on the build platform by the selected face.

## In Slow Motion

When the mouse wheel zooms in and out the view or moves the model, hold down the Ctrl key and everything will be in slow motion.

## Up and Down Key to Check Layers

When checking layer by layer, you can click the up and down key on the keyboard to move conveniently. In addition, hold down the space bar to pause the movement, and press the space bar again to restart automatic movement.

## Network Sending Feature

After slicing, many users are used to save the slicing file directly and copy it to the usb flash drive for printing. In fact, CHITUBOX Basic also has a network sending feature that allows you to send slicing file directly to a 3D printer for printing. The network sending feature should meet the following requirements: the printer should use CHITU system and the printer and router should be connected by network cable to ensure the computer and printer are under the same LAN.
