# How to Use Fix Translation to Fix or Change Translation of CHITUBOX

Found an error on the CHITUBOX Free UI translation? Or want to rename a UI item? You can edit your UI translation using the Fix Translation tool! Here is how:

1. Click **Main Menu > Language** and select the target language you want to change its translation.

    <ImageContainer>
    	<AntdImage
    		alt="change the language in CHITUBOX"
    		src={
    			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/how-to-use-fix-translation-to-fix-or-change-translation-of-chitubox/change-the-language.png"
    		}
    	/>
    </ImageContainer>

1. Click **Main Menu > Help > Fix Translation** to open the **Fix Translation**.

    <ImageContainer>
    	<AntdImage
    		alt="'fix translation' option in CHITUBOX"
    		src={
    			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/how-to-use-fix-translation-to-fix-or-change-translation-of-chitubox/fix-translation.png"
    		}
    	/>
    </ImageContainer>

1. Select from the list the item you want to change its translation. You can also use the search box to search for a certain item.

    <ImageContainer>
    	<AntdImage
    		alt="search box in the translation editing window"
    		src={
    			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/how-to-use-fix-translation-to-fix-or-change-translation-of-chitubox/search-box-in-the-translation-editing-window.png"
    		}
    	/>
    </ImageContainer>

1. Type the translation you would like to use in the **Translation**.

    <ImageContainer>
    	<AntdImage
    		alt="modify the translation in CHITUBOX"
    		src={
    			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/how-to-use-fix-translation-to-fix-or-change-translation-of-chitubox/modify-the-translation.png"
    		}
    	/>
    </ImageContainer>

1. Click the **Apply** button to apply your changes to your CHITUBOX Free software, or click **Export** to export a file that can be used on another CHITUBOX Free program. To import a translation file, simply click the **Import** button and select the file.

    <ImageContainer>
    	<AntdImage
    		alt="apply, export, import, or cancel the translation"
    		src={
    			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/how-to-use-fix-translation-to-fix-or-change-translation-of-chitubox/apply-export-import-or-cancel-the-translation.png"
    		}
    	/>
    </ImageContainer>

<Admonition type="note">
	When you hit the Apply button, the changes only apply to your own software.
	If you want to edit the translation of CHITUBOX on another computer, you can
	follow the steps above to change it there, or export your translation to
	that computer.
</Admonition>

If you think your translation is better than ours, and want us to use it on later CHITUBOX versions, you can export it and send the exported file to <Link href="mailto:support@chitubox.com">support@chitubox.com</Link>.
