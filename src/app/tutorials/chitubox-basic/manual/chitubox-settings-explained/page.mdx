# CHITUBOX Settings Explained!

In the Setting on CHITUBOX Free, there are options for you to modify so the program works as you would like it to. Here we will show you a list of detailed explanations of all these options. So you'll have a better grasp of how they work and what they could affect.

## Option 1: Enabling this option will calculate the volume when slicing...

_Enabling this option will calculate the volume when slicing. This option may make the slicing slow. If you want to optimize the slicing speed, you can turn off this option. The volume of the slice can be read from the saved slice file._

This option works as its description suggests. If you turn it on, the program will spend some time calculate the volume of the sliced model, and show the result after slicing. You will get the result **slower**.

The volume number will be displayed in the right pane of the Preview screen (next to where the Network sending and Save buttons are placed).

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="the volume of the sliced model"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/the-volume-of-the-sliced-model.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

If you turn it off, the program will not do the calculation when slicing. So it will slice **faster**. But you won't see the volume on the Preview screen.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="model volume is not calculated"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/model-volume-is-not-calculated.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Option 2: Graphics card backwards compatible mode

_Graphics card backwards compatible mode, if the model preview or point location selection is abnormal, you can check this mode, the program will use more memory in this mode, restart to take effect_

This option can fix compatibility issues with CHITUBOX Free when on some old graphics adapters. So if you're using a relatively old graphics card, and CHITUBOX Free isn't working properly on your computer, try turning on this option.

## Option 3: Enable thumbnail preview of desktop model

_Enable thumbnail preview of desktop model. Restart the computer to take effect._

This allows you to see a thumbnail preview when you're viewing your model files on your desktop or File Explorer.

Here is what you would see when this option is turned on or off:

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="thumbnail preview of desktop model"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/thumbnail-preview.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Option 4: In the support mode, the selected model is automatically placed in the center of the perspective

If you turn this option on, when you edit the support structures (select the Support tab), the camera will move to the center of the perspective, like this:

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="enable automatic centering of the model to perspective in the support mode"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/enable-automatic-centering-of-the-model.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

If this option is disabled, when you select the Support tab, the camera will stay at where it is:

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="disable automatic centering of the model to perspective in the support mode"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/disable-automatic-centering-of-the-model.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

If you don't like your camera to be moved automatically when clicking the Support tab, you should turn this option off.

## Option 5: Preview support

When manually adding supports, CHITUBOX gives you a live preview before adding them.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="preview support"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/preview-support.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Option 6: Display Support Auxiliary Line

When editing supports, there will be some short lines shown on the bottom surfaces and overhangs of your model to indicate support adding positions. These are Support Auxiliary Lines.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="display support auxiliary line"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/display-support-auxiliary-line.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

This setting allows you to show or hide these lines.

## Option 7: Open Graphic Tooltip

CHITUBOX has a tooltip feature. If you move your mouse pointer over a button or setting on your software interface, a tooltip will pop up, showing the function and usage of this button/setting.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="graphic tooltip"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/graphic-tooltip.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

If you turn this setting off, then the next time you move a pointer on a button, you won't see the tooltip.

## Option 8: Grid Spacing and Width

These two settings can set the distances and widths of your platform grids.

Grid Spacing sets the distances between each square. If this value is higher, these squares will get further away from one another. And the grey lines will be wider.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="grid spacing"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/grid-spacing.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Grid Width refers to the width of the grid. If this value is larger, the size of each square will get larger.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="grid width"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/grid-width.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Option 9: Sliced File Thumbnail View

This option will decide how your sliced model file would look like on your desktop or File Explorer:

-   Placement view - It shows how you placed the model at the moment you click the Slice button.
-   Home view - It shows how your model would look like when you click the Home icon on the CHITUBOX software.
-   Front view - The front of your model faces you.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="sliced file thumbnail view"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/sliced-file-thumbnail-view.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Option 10: Support Hidden Angle (0 - 90°)

When in the support editing mode, if you look at the model from below, the support structures would block the bottom part of your model, which could be inconvenient. So the program will automatically hide the support when you reach a certain degree of angle.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="supports are hidden when reaching a certain angle"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/supports-are-hidden-when-reaching-a-certain-angle.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

And this option allows you to change, when in the support editing mode, starting from which angle you want to hide the structures.

If, for instance, you set it to 30 degrees, then when the angle (between your line of vision and the line vertical to the bottom plane) is equal to or lower than 30 degrees, the support structures will disappear.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="angle illustration"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/tutorials/chitubox-basic/manual/chitubox-settings-explained/angle-illustration.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Option 11: Auto Save Interval

CHITUBOX Free has the auto save feature. It automatically saves your project at regular intervals. This option, Auto Save Interval, allows you to set that interval.

If, for example, you set it to 15 minutes, CHITUBOX Free saves your project every 15 minutes.

## Option 12: Auto Save Directory

Auto Save Directory allows you to specify which location you want the auto save feature of CHITUBOX Free to save your project.
