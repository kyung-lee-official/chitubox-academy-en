# CHITUBOX Pro Tutorial Collection——Lesson One: Basic Functions

In this Tutorial Collection we will show you how to use CHITUBOX Pro - and hopefully answer many of the popular questions from our users and potential buyers. So if you want to know more about CHITUBOX Pro, how to get the most from CHITUBOX Pro, this tutorial is for you.

## General Process For LCD 3D Printing

First, let's learn about the general process for LCD 3D printing, including Import, Repair, Edit, Auto Layout, Support and Slice. These are the preprocessing steps before you print your model.

Also, you can reach CHITUBOX Official Technical Support for help.

**Advantages for Pro:**

1. Humanized design for UI and visualized slicing operation for users

    - Optimized UI, added secondary menu, bottom toolbar and slice list, these are shortcuts for user to use.
    - For the supports editing function, provide supports types and supports editing illustrative visualization that able you to check the real-time status of your model when you editing.

1. Pro's same function modules upgraded to greater performance

    - Optimized algorithm for supports editing, added manually edit and semi-automatic edit with more parameters setting.
    - Support various 3D printing data format, added 3DS, 3MF, 3DM, STP format ect.
    - The algorithm for hollow function upgraded that provides a high quality hollowing performance, added a feature called Bottom Through.
    - Optimized auto layout function, added a feature called model nesting auto layout.
    - Optimized the function for modelrepairing, added intelligent repairing and semi-automatic repairing.
    - Added position marking in the function of island detection.

1. Pro added more function modules

    - Added function of Adding Tag.
    - Added function of Boolean Operation.
    - Added function of Suspend Detection.
    - Added function of Collision Detection.
    - Added function of slicing with multiple parameters

-   Tool Bar (Left Side)
    On the left side of the window in the tool bar. Shows the Select, Move, Rotate, Scale, and Mirror options.

-   File List and Slice List (Right Side)
    On the right side of the window. Shows the File list and Slice list. Add, Select, Reverse select, Automatic coloring, Display size, Delete files are provided in this file section.

Also, in the slice part comes with Add, Delete, Import, Export and Reset buttons. As there's a shortcut for you to set the required printing parameter easily. There are a couple of strategies that all work well for model slices. Like the slider that works for going up and down to check the cross sections of the model in the X, Y or Z direction. And another preview with the X and Y button, which means you can see the cross section of the model horizontally or vertically.

-   Display Window
    Display window is where you can individually arrange your models by clicking and dragging them on this panel. And the cube(upper right corner) is a shortcut key for you to check the all-round vision of the model. Or if you want to operate on each side of the model.

Global Coordinates(lower left corner) will show your model's x,y,z coordinates. Here(lower right corner) shows the shortcut keys list.

And you can click the little white arrow on the right to fold this section (File list and Slice list) if you want to maximize the Display window.

-   Bottom Menu & Status Notification

The bottom menu display the List of your available printing machines. You can easily add or delete your machines by clicking the column. Hide Platform is also another option you can use. Also, you use the mode to check your models in four different ways. Like the Left side view, the top side view, the front view and the main view. Operate on any of the small windows, the other three will synchronize the performance.

On the right side shows your models' info: Like how many vertex does your models have? Triangles, supports volume and price etc. Or point your model here will show your model's x,y,z coordinates info as well.

## Select, Move, Rotate, Scale, and Mirror Options

**Select**: Choose the mode you want.

By using Line, Curve, Rectangle, Polygon, Free-form options to frame your models. And one-key operation for Select All or Cancel All.

**Rotate**: Shift your model to a certain angle.

You can put in values to rotate models or bring up the rotate ring. Or choose a side to locate the model or combined several models together to rotate.

**Scale**: Set the model size.

You can put in values in X, Y, Z axis to scale the mode or locks the ratio if prefer your model in an original form. Or you want to choose not have the access locked so you can make the model in your own way. Or reset.

**Mirror**: Mirroring operations on your model.

You can very easily to mirror your model if you want a left or right version of a particular model that you print. You can choose to keep the original model if you want.
