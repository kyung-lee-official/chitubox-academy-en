**When and how did you come across 3D printing? Why did you choose 3D printing as a medium to create?**

During my time in the orthodontic residency, dental scanners started to gain popularity. There was a lack of research and information about this technology back then, but I quickly recognized its potential.

With the help of my mentor at that time, Dr. Alberto Teramoto, we began exploring various applications of digital models in orthodontics. Eventually, we came across the necessity to convert this data into physical objects.

Initially, we experimented with Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, but this method had lower resolutions compared to resin 3D printing at that time, leading to poor reproduction of small details. At that time, only large resin printers were available from companies like Stratasys, but the cost of such equipment was prohibitive. Fortunately, after a few years, patents expired, and low-cost LCD printers emerged, changing the game for everyone.

**Can you share the role of 3D printing in the field of implantology and its impact on treatment?**

The appearance of biocompatible resins opened up a plethora of options for dental 3D printing. Implantology became one of the primary fields and early adopters of this technology. Surgical guidance enables a more precise, predictable, and comfortable procedure for both the patient and the dentist.

Even though I do not perform dental implant rehabilitation, we have successfully integrated this workflow for orthodontic miniscrew insertion, leading to outstanding results and maximum efficiency.

**Can you provide examples of complex dental cases where 3D printing played a crucial role in the treatment plan?**

I believe, as other clinicians may have experienced, that multidisciplinary cases are the most challenging. In our cases, 3D technology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment planning phases, and 3D printing is the key component for executing this plan in a coordinated fashion.

A good example could be orthognathic surgical cases where we digitally design all the osteotomies and bone movements. We then transfer this information to the patient during the intervention using a 3D-printed surgical splint. Also, we plan ortho-prostho treatments to establish a working vertical dimension coordinated within both treatments.

**How does 3D printing contribute to the efficiency and productivity of a digital dental practice?**

Dental 3D printing allows labs and clinicians to fabricate a wide variety of components, ranging from dental models to surgical guides, prosthetics and custom appliances. I think 3D printing is becoming so popular in dentistry due to its precision, efficiency, and low cost. Also, the digital workflow has evolved and it is more simple than ever. The dental community is highly proactive in this matter, and I can see how we are finding new applications of this technology every week.

**How does 3D printing enhance the fabrication of clear aligners or orthodontic appliances?**

Essentially, 3D printing is the only viable method for producing dental aligners. For a long time, only big companies could provide these appliances. However, today, it is within reach for anyone to utilize this technology. Additionally, some new resins will enable direct aligner printing, which is going to revolutionize this treatment forever.

**Can you give us a few examples on how CHITUBOX integrates within the dental workflow? How does CHITUBOX benefit digital dentistry practices?**

Absolutely. Many features of CHitubox are very convenient for the dental workflow:

First, auto-supports. CHITUBOX allows the generation of customized supports for dental models during the 3D printing process. Supports are structures that help stabilize the model while printing and are later removed. CHITUBOX provides tools to generate and adjust supports according to specific requirements, ensuring optimal print quality and reducing the risk of failures or distortions. Faster and easier.

Second, Add Tag feature. It allows you to add text on your model surface, or on the platform as a self-made text model. Very useful for dental aligner models.

Third, hollowing feature. Printing hollowed dental models will save on resin and printing costs. The Hollow function in CHITUBOX is remarkably intuitive and efficient. It enables you to prepare dental models within seconds, including the addition of venting holes to prevent deformation and resin from being trapped.

CHITUBOX also supports Multi-Parameter Slice, which is ideal for faster printing of dental models. This feature allows for lower resolution at the base and higher resolution at the critical parts, ensuring efficient and accurate printing of the models. Auto repair function. Incorrect meshes are the main reason for printing failure. Using this feature we can ensure a proper mesh with one click.

**What do you anticipate from the marriage of Chitubox's 3D technology and the future of digital dentistry?**

Overall, CHITUBOX has become an invaluable tool in dentistry, empowering dental professionals to enhance treatment accuracy, efficiency, and patient care through cases 3D printing technology and digital workflows. I believe that the fewer tools we have to learn, the more efficient our digital workflow can be. CHITUBOX's broad compatibility with many resin printers is a key advantage for a busy dental practice.
