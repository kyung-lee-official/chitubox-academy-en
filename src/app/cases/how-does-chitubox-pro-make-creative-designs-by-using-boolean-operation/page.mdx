# How does CHITUBOX Pro make creative designs by using Boolean Operation?

Who said that 3D printing preparation programs can only slice models? With CHITUBOX Pro, one of the powerful features called Boolean Operation, enables union,intersection or subtraction operations between models by specific computing, and come up with a new form of models that could help us to make creative designs.

Check this out! A perfectly transparent Santa Crystal Ball is shining in the sun.

Look at this Christmas Spin Lantern. It can rotate 360 degrees and there's a different pattern/model on each side.

You would think that this model was made from scratch by a 3D modeler. However, Santa, ball, model base, Christmas tree, bell, and reindeer are separate 3D models.

To work on the creative idea, we need to rearrange the position of these separate models. By using the specific computing of the Boolean Operation that could make an interesting brand-new model. Also, cutting the model instead of digging a hole can provide a solid foundation for the crystal ball.

Let's watch it together~

Easy peasy! Perhaps creative designs needn't be far off. With CHITUBOX Pro, we can make original and interesting works on our own!

Thee above practice, you have learned? Let's give it a try!
