# Follow Your Instincts, Unleash Your Imagination, Ignite Your Creation

Luca (<Link href="https://www.instagram.com/lotr.craft.paint">@lotr.craft.paint</Link> on Instagram), a mad crafter of Lord of the Rings scenery based in Switzerland, has a mission to create massive, realistic tables for Middle Earth 28mm wargaming and enjoy playing on them with the LOTR community. He creates amazingly detailed scenery from a simple bottle of resin while painting miniatures and dreaming about his next creations, all while enjoying a cup of coffee.

Luca initially started with foam and clay as a crafter and artist, but soon realized he desired more details and realism. 3D printing became the obvious next step, and with the abundance of files available online, he was able to shift gears and enhance his LOTR creations.”

He loves creating massive, action-packed scenes inspired by the Lord of the Rings movies. His terrain is always busy, filled with numerous buildings and captivating scenery. He enjoys immersing himself in the chaos of battle, ensuring that every part of the table stands as a unique diorama.

Luca's extraordinary tables never fail to create a captivating "wow" effect that attracts audiences from around the world. He has a profound love for eccentricity, enormous dioramas, and all things imaginative. Moreover, he aspires to inspire others through his artwork, encouraging them to craft their own Middle Earth haven.

"Luca, could you share your creative philosophy and dream with us?" When asked, he simply replied, “Instinct." Whenever an idea arises, and he can envision it in his mind, Luca follows his instincts and brings it to life. "I don't overthink it. I enjoy constructing tables, and the process of creation is what I cherish the most," Luca expressed.
