's works always provide people with a unique visual experience, displaying
various cultures and characteristics, and are therefore deeply loved by users.
He himself is very fond of Asian culture, particularly enamored with traditional
Chinese history and culture, and enjoys incorporating these cultural elements
into his work.

His innovative achievements in the field of 3D printing design embody his love for Chinese culture and his pursuit of exquisite craftsmanship. "I am a Chinese artist and I want to introduce outstanding Chinese culture to the world."

In order to have more Asian representatives of micro-sculpture works in this field and to bring a more authentic feeling to his works, Mushu often tries to find inspiration from the culture and surroundings around him, or visits local museums. "there are times where our culture gets mixed up or misinterpreted with other culture, so I try to bring something more authentic to show them." Mushu pours all his passion into every piece of work he designs.

**The songstress of the river**

Among numerous works, Mushu's favorite is "The Songstress of the River" because it integrates modern technology and cultural art very well, and you can almost see various elements of traditional Chinese historical culture everywhere in it.

At first glance of this work, I believe everyone will have a feeling of "deja vu". Yes, in 2021, Henan TV stunned everyone with a song called "Luoshen Water Fu", and it became an instant hit, "graceful as a startled swan, gentle as a swimming dragon." This wonderful performance also inspired Mushu to come up with new ideas by combining 3D printing technology with other Asian cultural elements, and soon designed "The Songstress of the River", a very creative work.

In order to better showcase the visual impact of dancing in water and the interplay of light and shadow, Mushu designed "The Songstress of the River" with LED lighting. There is a battery compartment and wire hole at the bottom of the model. When the LED lights are turned on, all the beauty of "The Songstress of the River" is truly revealed.

Currently, "The Songstress of the River" has been crowdfunded on <Link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragongatetavern/songstress-of-the-river-stl-3d-model?ref=discovery&term=songstress%20of%20the%20river" >kickstarter</Link>

According to Mushu's crowdfunding plan, the work will be completed and the STL file will be available for download in April of this year.

Mushu's another work, "The Enchanted Hot Spring", is inspired by Japanese culture. Although it looks quite similar to "The Songstress of the River", if you observe carefully, you will find that they are different. And this is exactly what Mushu wants to show and convey to people - Chinese culture is different from Japanese culture. Chinese culture is more profound, extensive, and has a long history, with unique national characteristics and spiritual features.

**Wonderful Journey with CHITUBOX**

Mushu also shared his 3D printing journey with us. He started to get involved in 3D printing in August 2022 and initially used FDM. However, he quickly realized the limitations of FDM in terms of details and turned to resin-based 3D printing.

"I chose CHITUBOX slicing software because it is very user-friendly, works very well with my Saturn 8K, and has many great features that are helpful for beginners," Mushu excitedly told us. The friendly and easy-to-use user interface design of CHITUBOX allows him to quickly find the features he needs. Using CHITUBOX, even for a simple slice, Mushu can accurately identify where his model has "islands" and then promptly address them to ensure that his model does not have any issues during printing.

"At first, I was not good at adding supports, and I didn't have time to learn how to process supports professionally. So I often use CHITUBOX's automatic support function. As a result, I found that the printed model has very good results, and all the details I want are perfectly displayed. CHITUBOX is really powerful."

But what Mushu likes most about CHUTUBOX is that the software does not take up much computer space or affect the operation of the computer while in use. He can even play music while using blender and CHITUBOX at the same time, creating a relaxed and pleasant working environment that allows him to focus more on creating.

As time goes on and Mushu delves deeper into resin-based 3D printing and creative design, he is no longer limited to just a hobby. 3D printing has opened up a new path for him in life - entrepreneurship. Through 3D printing, he meets new friends from all walks of life every day, learns new skills related to 3D printing together, and derives much enjoyment from it.
