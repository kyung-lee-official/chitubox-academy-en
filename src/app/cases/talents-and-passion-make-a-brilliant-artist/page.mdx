**Q1: When and how did you come across 3D printing? Why did you choose 3D printing as a medium to create?**

I’ve heard for quite a long time about 3d printing, but I didn’t look at it for quite a while. Mainly because, especially in the beginning, it looked very technical from the outside and quite daunting to take on. Being a very “digital” person always seemed a bit far from what I normally do. Then a friend of a friend bought a 3D printer. After printing a few things, he didn’t know what else to do with it. So I asked him if he could print one of my sculptures. Once I saw one of my digital files becoming a reality, there was no turning back.

**Q2: Where do you get most of your creative inspiration from? In which of your works are they reflected? Can you give us some examples?**

From a lot of places, actually. I really love illustration and painting, and I follow a lot of great artists. I love seeing their work and the spark of inspiration that some artworks give me when I see them. I also love classical sculpture and the concept of beauty through forms. Many of the sculptures that we produce are just fantasy miniatures, but when there is enough time, I try to add that “extra” layer of attention that more classical sculptures have. Like Ishim the Fallen could have been just a regular, dark, fallen paladin, but the extra character, the drapery, and the expression are all aimed to provide that reference to the beauty of classical sculpture.

**Q3: What kind of role do you think your artworks play? What do you hope to bring to the audience through these works, or what educational meaning do you have in them?**

My favorite artworks, especially in illustration, are those that, just with a quick glance, can get your imagination going and take you to those beautiful, distant worlds. Illustrations that don’t tell the whole story, but just enough for the viewer to be able to complete them with their own story. I’d like one day for my sculptures to have this same effect and to take the audience on a journey to distant and magical worlds.

**Q4: As an artist, what is your creative philosophy and dream? What do you want to tell people most?**

I’ve always loved characters, personal stories, and emotions. I’d love one day for my models to go beyond the “just a beautiful display piece” to be able to tell deep, compelling stories and adventures.

**Q5: How do you think CHITUBOX helps you in the creative process, or what kind of work do you often use it for? What would you like to tell us about CHITUBOX?**

CHITUBOX is the first software that I used for professional supports. I used another software before it, but it was really hard to manage. With CHITUBOX supports, it became a breeze, and prototyping went really fast.

**Q6: What kind of creative work do you want to do in the future, and do you have any new plans or ideas?**

Lots of ideas and very little time. I like to dream big, so as soon as I’ll have enough time, I’m planning on some big changes to come. Stay tuned for my future projects.

**Q7: Do you have any suggestions for beginners in 3D printing?**

Nowadays, 3D printing is much more accessible and streamlined. There are many more tutorials and explanations on the internet, software compatibility is much more reliable, etc. The first suggestion is just to learn how it works: no matter how good the printer, the software or the presupported files are, one must always be able to troubleshoot by him/herself as each printing condition is unique.

**Q8: What are the best parts of 3D printing in your daily life?**

For me, as a creator, the best part of all of this is seeing how other people print my models, give them life and bring their own stories into them. This is the biggest reward I could ask for.
